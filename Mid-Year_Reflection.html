    <h1>Mid-Year Reflection</h1>
    
    <body><ol><li> I mostly have a good amount of friends that I'm really close with but at lunch most of the 8th graders usually do activities together. Even though I have 7 friends that I'm really close with, I still talk and do stuff with a good amount of the 8th graders. I think I could improve on my social atmosphere by maybe talking a little more to the 6th graders.</li>
    <li>I've gone to a couple of out of school Rhoades activities such as Casa de Amistad and feeding America. Me and a couple of friends have made presentations in small group advisory on topics that could benefit the future of the Rhoades School. </li>
    <li>I finish my work on time about 96% of the time. Spreading my homework throughout the whole week helps me. Out of school activites such as drums and basketball hinder me.</li>
