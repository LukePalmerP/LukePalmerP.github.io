    <h1>Smart Goal</h1>
    
  <body>
My Smart goal for the school year is to prevent summaries from occuring in my essays. Whenever I write, I always re-read my work. By doing this I am checking for summaries and if I see one starting to form, I will know and I will be able to fix it. At this point I have mastered the summary. I am focusing more on analysis, evidence, and proving the point of my essay. I also try to right rough drafts before writing my final essay. Rough drafts help give me a good idea of what is going to be my final essay.
